## Welcome to OpenTour

We are creating an open and free to use API that can be used by any travel company or software provider to connect their vendors and customers.

The travel industry has so many different APIs that to integrate to a new vendor it is very expensive to accomplish. We are creating a protocol that is easy to implement and make it easy to connect to as many of your business partners as possible.

We have created a website with built in Symfony/PHP that implements any software the uses the OpenTour format
