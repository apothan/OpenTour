## Welcome to the OpenTour

We are trying to create an open and free to use api that can be used by any travel company or software provider to connect to their vendors and customers.

The travel industry has so many different apis that to integrate to a new vendor it is very expensive to accomplish. We are trying to create a protocol that is easy to implement and make it easy to connect to as many of your business partners as possible.
